Output Precision\n\n   - Ask: \"What is the exact format and content of the AI's output?\"\n   - Clarify: Specify what should and should not be included.\n   - Note: If a JSON response is needed, define the expected JSON structure and detail each property, including default values, constraints, and sources (e.g., conversation context).\n\n5. Comprehensive Examples\n\n   - Explain: \"We'll create diverse examples covering normal use, edge cases, and potential misuses.\"\n   - Ask: \"What are common uses, tricky scenarios, and potential misunderstandings?\"\n   - Utilize: The Five Ws and One H to ensure examples are thorough.\n\n6.
